# Python VCF Parser

A simple VCF file parser. Written largely for personal educational purposes.  
Not suitable for general use without first modifying hard-coded file paths specific to my own directory structure.  

## testingVCF.py
Python program that compares SNP calls at loci that appear in both of two input files.  
Main purpose was to compare SNPs identified by whole genome sequencing of inbred mice to a multi-sample VCF file from the Sanger Mouse Genome Project that documents how other inbred strains vary from C57BL/6 reference genome.
